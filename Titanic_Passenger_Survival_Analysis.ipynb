              "'342 passengers suvived the Titanic crash which is 38.38 percent of passengers on board. Higher sibling count did not correlate to higher chances of survival as evidenced by data. Infact lower sibling count ensured higher chances of survival. Higher family count did not correlate to higher chances of survival as evidenced by data. Infact lower family count ensured higher chances of survival. Based on data, it can also be assumed that there were not many big families onboard the ship. Hence the low rescue numbers of big familiesPassengers traveling in the First Class cabins had higher chances of survival. Smaller family size 0, 1 and 2 and members in the upper class had higher chances of survival as evidenced by data. Females in first class were prioritized in the rescue mission while those in 2 and 3 class were given second priority. Men traveling in 2nd class were given least priority in the rescue missions. 217 passengers that survived embarked at location S which constituted 63.45 of total passengers 140 of whom were females. 61 children were rescued in the mission, which is 17.84 percent of total survivors.'"
