        "Based on the graph showing the average accuracy score for different values of k in the KNN classifier, we can draw several conclusions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Impact of k on Accuracy: The graph illustrates how the choice of the number of neighbors (k) affects the model's performance. Generally, we observe a trend where the accuracy score tends to change with different values of k.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Optimal k: There appears to be an optimal value of k that maximizes the average accuracy score. In the graph, this is the point where the accuracy score peaks (5 - 10) before decreasing (after 10). It suggests that selecting an appropriate value for k is crucial for achieving the best classification performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Bias-Variance Tradeoff: The relationship between k and accuracy reflects the tradeoff between bias and variance in the model. Lower values of k (e.g., k=1) tend to have higher variance and lower bias, resulting in potentially overfitting the training data. On the other hand, larger values of k (e.g., k=50) lead to higher bias and lower variance, potentially resulting in underfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Model Robustness: The consistency of accuracy scores across different values of k indicates the robustness of the KNN model. If the accuracy scores vary significantly with changes in k, it suggests that the model's performance is sensitive to the choice of hyperparameter.\n",
        "\n",
